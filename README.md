# Function Declarations
The goal of this program is to practice using function vocabulary and write functions which alter and return a new output.  There are 10 total functions to be completed.  Type below each comment.

## Math Resources
Some of the questions require some intermediate math functions and constants.  JavaScript has stored these conveniently in a MATH LIBRARY.  You can access them by typing Math.functionName() - here is a link [Math Lib](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) to a list of all of your options.

#### Short Math list
-  The square root function : **Math.sqrt(** input goes here **)**
-  The number PI to many decimals : **Math.PI**
-  How to round a number : **Math.round(** input goes here **)**

## String Resources
Do not forget that you can **glue** strings together with the plus sign **+**.  This important for inserting your variable into the string you want.  We also explored how to use string template literals briefly if you want to go that route.  Here is a link to [string template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) if you do not want to use the plus sign.
